    "We use state-of-the-art bayesian causal models to investigate the role of parking zoning reform in Minneapolis on the development of new housing units, at a relatively fine-grained level of census tracts. Minneapolis is an example of a city which somewhat sucessfuly navigates the housing crisis, and a parking zoning reform has been claimed to be connected to this outcome (see for example [here](https://reason.com/2024/02/27/fear-loathing-and-zoning-reform-in-minnesota/) and [here](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/9/15/ending-minimum-parking-requirements-was-a-policy-win-for-the-twin-cities)).\n",

    "## Why this is not a typical machine learning project\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical predictive project in machine learning tends to use as much data as possible and uses algorithms to identify patters, focusing only on predictive accuracy. While such an approach is useful, the key limitation is that such models have a hard time distinguishing accidental correlations from causal connections, and therefore are not realiable guides to counterfactual predictions and causal effect evaluation. Moreover, a typical model often disregards information that humans use heavily: temporal or causal structures, which are needed to generalize well outside the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we use our core open source technology, [ChiRho](https://github.com/BasisResearch/chirho) to build **bayesian causal** models using hand-picked relevant variables. This way, we work with humans and domain experts in the loop. The fact that we use Bayesian methods, allow for the injection of their deep understanding of the ecosystem, which can be work in symbiosis with the data, even if the latter is somewhat limited. The fact that the models is causal gives us a chance to try to draw conclusions about effects of intereventions, and quantify the uncertainties involved and be honest about them.\n",
