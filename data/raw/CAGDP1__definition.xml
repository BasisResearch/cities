The value of the quantity index is 100 for the base year.BEA uses chain-type annual-weighted indexes, also known as Fisher indexes, as its measure of real output and prices. These measures allow for the effects of changes in relative prices and in the composition of output over time, thereby eliminating a major source of bias inherent in fixed-weight indexes.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>3</Code><Description>Current-dollar GDP (thousands of current dollars)</Description><Definition>Gross domestic product (GDP) by county and metropolitan area is the measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced within an area in a particular period of time.
